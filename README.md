Applied methodologies and standardized baselines AM0123-“Renewable energy generation for captive
use”, v-1.0

Standardized baselines- Not Applicable

SECTORAL SCOPE – 01 - Energy industries (Renewable/Non-renewable sources)
TYPE I - Renewable Energy Projects
CATEGORY- AM0123 (Title: “Renewable energy generation for captive use”, version 01.0)

Applicability of methodologies and standardized baselines >>
This methodology is applicable to renewable
energy power generation project activities
that install a greenfield power plant supplying
electricity to the captive consumer via:
(a) A grid interface through a wheeling; or
(b) A dedicated electricity transmission and
distribution line
_______________________
The project activity is a greenfield project
activity that will install a rooftop solar power
generation projects which will supply electricity
to captive consumer via dedicated electricity
transmission and distribution line.
Hence this criterion is applicable

Sectoral scopes 01 Energy industries (Renewable/Non-renewable
Sources)

The Project activity includes installation of Solar Photovoltaic Panels on roofs of government
buildings/institutions located in various districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) state of India. The project
activity is implemented by Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency
(UPNEDA). The purpose of the project activity is to transition to a source of clean electricity
generation. The rooftop solar projects installed on each building will generate solar power which
will be utilized for the energy needs of the building where the modules are installed. In the absence
of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity generated from the project would have
been drawn in from the carbon intensive national grid which is also the baseline scenario of the
project activity. The project activity will thus reduce the anthropogenic emissions of Green House
Gases (GHGs) in to the atmosphere associated with the equivalent amount of electricity generation
from the fossil fuel-based grid connected power plant.

The project activity is a bundled project activity which involves installation of rooftop solar projects
on 1,333 different government buildings across 75 districts of UP. The installation details of the
SPV-modules are provided in Appendix-1 of this PCN.

The start date of the project activity is 14/08/2016 which is the date of installation of the 1st rooftop
solar project in the plant. While UPNEDA has installed the project activity and are the legal owners
of the credits to be generated, they have authorised Nextgen Infoworld Pvt Ltd to act on their behalf
to initiate and process the project to get registered and issue the COUs under UCR. The total energy
that will be generated through all the SPV modules combined will be around 160,379.26 MW. The
project will lead to overall 144,341 tCO2e per year emission reductions.
